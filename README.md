 🔭 I’m currently working on **a personal portfolio**
 
 🌱 I’m currently learning **Docker, Supabase, AWS, Redis**
 
 🛠️ I was the lead backend developer for 
 <a href="https://dev.virtualcyber.co.ke/"> **Virtual Cyber Support**</a>, where we worked with Node Js, Express Js, Mongo db. The best exprience I got from this job was how to Implement a very secure payment method using Safaricom's **Daraja API**. I believe this was a Mega project that dealt with over 25 user forms and hence it covered most parts of backend development with NODE JS!! I also did the frontend for Virtual Cyber Support!

⚡ Fun fact **Node Js was originally written in 2009 by Ryan Dahl, inspired by a desire to create a server-side technology that could handle asynchronous I/O operations efficiently for building scalable network applications. Dahl famously presented Node.js for the first time at the inaugural JSConf event in Berlin in 2009. His presentation was a mere 30 minutes long and featured live coding. This short, impactful presentation helped spark the interest and adoption of Node.js within the developer community.**
